I used the stock firmware of the Wanhao Duplicator i3 (v2) printer for years. 
This firmware lacks the thermal runaway protection so that was basically the main reason to upgrade the firmware.

I choose the Marlin firmware, version 2.0.5.3 at the moment of writing and flashed a bootloader and after that upgraded the firmware. 
There are plenty of tutorials on how to do this.

This repo contains the two config files that contain the settings that work for me. Especially getting the LCD to work was kinda tricky, but it works now!
If you stumble upon the issue that your LCD is messed up, add the following to configuration.h:
#define ST7920_DELAY_2 DELAY_NS(400)

And uncomment:
#define LCD_FOR_MELZI

This worked for me.
